This is an assignment for CSC 242 that I wrote code for. This project asks us to modify/create three assembly programs, placing them into a framework that was given to us. The inputs and outputs can be found in the "Individual Problems" folder. More specific directions can be found in the project directions.

Notice: 

 - To run each program (In Visual Studio), you will have to change the _MainProc(1,2,3) (2 occurances on each file) to be _MainProc :)
 - Problem #1 Will Run At Start! 

Problems: 

 - If you hit the "X" button in a dialog box it will initialize that variable with "0"
